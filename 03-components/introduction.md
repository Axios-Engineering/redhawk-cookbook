Components
==========

Components occupy the starring role for REDHAWK development. REDHAWK
applications are made up of one or more components and all components
implement a common API , the *CF::Resource* interface. Unlike other SDR
frameworks, components are treated as black-box entities and can be
implemented using any technique or programming language. Furthermore,
components exist at all levels of granularity from that of a simple DSP
to an entire application.
