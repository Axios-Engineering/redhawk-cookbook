Libraries and Interfaces
========================

The core REDHAWK interfaces are an extension of the [SCA
2.2.2](http://jtnc.mil/sca/Documents/SCAv2_2_2/SCA_version_2_2_2.pdf)
specification. With a CORBA implementation and the IDLs distributed
within REDHAWK, you can build your own clients, components, and devices.
While this is fully possible, REDHAWK provides both client and
component/device runtime libraries that assist with building REDHAWK
applications.
